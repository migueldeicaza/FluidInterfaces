This is a line-by-line port of Nathan Gitter's Fluent Interfaces
project that shows how to implement the various idioms that Apple
showed on their "Fluid Interfaces" talk at WWDC 2018.

This is still missing a couple of ports, but figured I could open it up
now for people to try out.  And I messed up the layout for some controls
in one of the samples, need to fix that.
